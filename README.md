Background of website design
During May 2017, EternalBlue, a trojan horse virus burst all over the world even though the patch to fix the vulnerability was issued by Mircosoft in March 2017. As the problems concerned with Internet security getting increased significant, it is meaningful to do something to help raise peopleâ€™s awareness of the importance of Information Security.  

What does this website tell?
This website basically introduces several types of network attacks classified by countries. Visitors can view the top five kinds of network attacks on a certain country within one month and see more detailed information of those attacks such as possible information-security vulnerabilities that might be attacked and referenced methods to fix them.

How is it built?
The website integrates the statistics from those three websites: Cyberthreat Map, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, and National Vulnerabilities Database. A variety of network attacks on different countries are web-crawlled from Cyberthreat Real-time Map. Description of the vulnerabilities and referenced-method are downloaded from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures and National Vulnerabilities Database and classified by Python.
